# serverside-practice
Some remedial practice with JS/Node/Express coding. This repo will be public and visible to potential employers, as well.

(The first couple of commits are under the name "French Toast" due to a mistake I made with the "git config" command)


## To run:

- Install mysql ([I used the Windows installation instructions from here.](https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_install_windows.asp#:~:text=The%20simplest%20and%20recommended%20method,%2D8.0.23.msi%20))
- Make sure your mySQL server is running. In my case, this involves using services.msc to launch it and the nySQL command line cline to sign in.
- Go to http://localhost:3000/quizzes to see a list of dynamic SQL entries, or go to http://localhost:3000/quizzes/new to create new ones.
